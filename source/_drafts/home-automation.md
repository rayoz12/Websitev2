# Home Automation using Home Assistant and Node-RED

Home Automation is a popular topic these days and everyone is seeking to make their homes work for
for them instead of the other way around. Since Sydney recently went into lockdown because of the
Delta strain, I've been looking for a quick project to do and I had some ideas already about how
I can set things up to run automatically.

A unique setting of my environment is that I live alone so I don't have to consider the case of
of someone else triggering an automation an wondering it's what's happening.
