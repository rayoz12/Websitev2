# Service & Teamwork
In pursuit of giving back to the community where can I've performed many community acts where I can.

## Parish Digital Library
Volunteering at my local church I've designed a cloud digital library system that manages projections and music 
sheets for a mass of 500+ people. Automated the generation of weekly projections converting an hour task to a 2 minute one. 
Designed and developed presentation software that is bundled into projections to provide an in-house and customised solution
to the presentation needs of the church. Ability to generate hymns and edit them all within the browser although they are stored
in a Word compatible format to retain compatibility.
